        On my walk
        At the top of the hill
        And it's perfecly round
        And it's perfecly still</div>
    <div class="borda2">And it holds back the clouds
                Whith its circle of light
                And it's perfecly round
                And it's perfecly bright</div> 
    <div class="borda3">It's a full
        As a hug
        And as cool as a stare
        And it's perfecly round
        Even when it's not There</div>
